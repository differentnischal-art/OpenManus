# 👋 OpenManus

Manus is incredible, but OpenManus can achieve any idea without an *Invite Code* 🛫!

Our team members [@Xinbin Liang](https://github.com/mannaandpoem) and [@Jinyu Xiang](https://github.com/XiangJinyu) (core authors), along with [@Zhaoyang Yu](https://github.com/MoshiQAQ), [@Jiayi Zhang](https://github.com/didiforgithub), and [@Sirui Hong](https://github.com/stellaHSR), we are from [@MetaGPT](https://github.com/geekan/MetaGPT). The prototype is launched within 3 hours and we are keeping building!

It's a simple implementation, so we welcome any suggestions, contributions, and feedback!

Enjoy your own agent with OpenManus!

We're also excited to introduce [OpenManus-RL](https://github.com/OpenManus/OpenManus-RL), an open-source project dedicated to reinforcement learning (RL)- based (such as GRPO) tuning methods for LLM agents, developed collaboratively by researchers from UIUC and OpenManus.

## Project Demo

## Installation

We provide two installation methods. Method 2 (using uv) is recommended for faster installation and better dependency management.

### Method 1: Using conda

1. Create a new conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n open_manus python=3.11
conda activate open_manus
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus.git
cd OpenManus
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Method 2: Using uv (Recommended)

1. Install uv (A fast Python package installer and resolver):

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

2. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FoundationAgents/OpenManus.git
cd OpenManus
```

3. Create a new virtual environment and activate it:

```bash
uv venv --python 3.11
source .venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Browser Automation Tool (Optional)
```bash
playwright install
```

## Configuration

OpenManus requires configuration for the LLM APIs it uses.

1. Create a `config.toml` file:

```bash
cp config/config.example.toml config/config.toml
```

2. Edit `config/config.toml` and add your API keys.

## Quick Start

```bash
python main.py
```

For MCP tool version:

```bash
python run_mcp.py
```

For multi-agent version:

```bash
python run_flow.py
```
